=================================

Figure number: Figure 3.35
From the IPCC Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Chapter 3

![Figure 3.35](../images/ar6_wg1_chap3_fig3_35_sam_millenium.png?raw=true)


Description:
------------
SAM indices in the last millennium. (a) Annual SAM reconstructions by Abram et 
al. (2014) and Dätwyler et al. (2018). (b) The annual-mean SAM index defined by 
Gong and Wang (1999) in CMIP5 and CMIP6 Last Millennium simulations extended by 
historical simulations. All indices are normalized with respect to 1961-1990 
means and standard deviations. Thin lines and thick lines show 7-year and 70-
year moving averages, respectively.

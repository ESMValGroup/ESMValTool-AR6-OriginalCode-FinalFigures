TRENDS IN TOTAL COLUMN WATER VAPOR
==================================

Figure number: Figure 3.12
From the IPCC Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Chapter X

![Figure 3.12](../images/ar6_wg1_chap3_figure3_12_water_vapor_trends.png?raw=true)


Description:
------------
Column water vapor path trends (%/decade) for the period 1998-2019 averaged over 
the near-global oceans (50°S-50°N). The figure shows satellite data (RSS) and 
ERA5.1 reanalysis, as well as CMIP5 (sky blue) and CMIP6 (brown) historical 
simulations. All available ensemble members were used (see Section 3.2. Fits to 
the model trend probability distributions were performed with kernel density 
estimation. Figure is updated from Santer et al. (2007).

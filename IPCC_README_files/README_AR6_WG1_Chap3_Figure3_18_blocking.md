BLOCKING
========

Figure number: Figure 3.18
From the IPCC Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Chapter X

![Figure 3.18](../images/ar6_wg1_chap3_figure3_18_blocking.png?raw=true)


Description:
------------
Instantaneous Northern-Hemisphere blocking frequency (% of days) in the extended
northern winter season (DJFM) for the years 1979-2000. Results are shown for 
ERA5 reanalysis (black), CMIP5 (blue) and CMIP6 (red) models. Coloured lines 
show multi-model means and shaded ranges show corresponding 5-95% constructed 
with one realization from each model Figure is adapted from Davini and D’Andrea 
(2020), their Figure 12 and following the D’Andrea et al. (1998) definition of 
blocking.

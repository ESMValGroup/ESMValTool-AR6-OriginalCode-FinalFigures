Description:
------------
Attribution of observed seasonal trends in the annular modes to forcings. 
Simulated and observed trends in NAM indices over 1958-2019 (a) and in SAM 
indices over 1979-2019 (b) and over 2000-2019 (c) for boreal winter (December-
February average; DJF) and summer (June-August average; JJA). The indices are 
based on the difference of the normalized zonally averaged monthly mean sea 
level pressure between 35ºN and 65ºN for the NAM and between 40ºS and 65ºS for 
the SAM as defined in Jianping and Wang (2003) and Gong and Wang (1999), 
respectively: the unit is decade–1. Ensemble mean, interquartile ranges and 5th 
and 95th percentiles are represented by empty boxes and whiskers for pre-
industrial control simulations and historical simulations. The number of 
ensemble members and models used for computing the distribution is given in the 
upper-left legend. Grey lines show observed trends from the ERA5 and JRA-55 
reanalyses. Multi-model multi-member ensemble means of the forced component of 
the trends as well as their 5- 95% confidence intervals assessed from 
t-statistics, are represented by filled boxes, based on CMIP6 individual forcing 
simulations from DAMIP ensembles; greenhouse gases in brown, aerosols in light 
blue, stratospheric ozone in purple and natural forcing in green. Models with at 
least 3 ensemble members are used for the filled boxes, with black dots 
representing the ensemble means of individual models.

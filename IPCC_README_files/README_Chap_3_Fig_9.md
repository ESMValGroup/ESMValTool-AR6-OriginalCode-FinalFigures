ANOMALY OF NERA-SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE - ATTRIBUTION
=====================================================

Figure number: Figure 3.9
From the IPCC Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Chapter 3

![Figure 3.9](../images/figure_3_9.png?raw=true)


Description:
------------
Global, land, ocean and continental annual mean near-surface air temperatures
anomalies in CMIP6 models and observations. Timeseries are shown for CMIP6 
historical anthropogenic and natural (brown) natural-only (green), greenhouse 
gas only (grey) and aerosol only (blue) simulations (multi-model means shown as
thick lines, and shaded ranges between the 5th and 95th percentiles) and for 
HadCRUT5 (black). All models have been subsampled using the HadCRUT5 
observational data mask. Temperatures anomalies are shown relative to 1950-2010 
for Antarctica and relative to 1850â€“1900 for other continents. CMIP6 historical 
simulations are expand by the SSP2-4.5 scenario simulations. All available 
ensemble members were used (see Section 3.2). Regions are defined by 
Iturbide et al. (2020).

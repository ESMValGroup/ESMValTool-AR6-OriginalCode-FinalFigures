Description:
------------
Model evaluation of global monsoon domain, intensity, and circulation. (a-b) 
Climatological summer-winter range of precipitation rate, scaled by annual mean 
precipitation rate (shading) and 850 hPa wind velocity (arrows) based on (a) 
GPCP and ERA5 and (b) a multi-model ensemble mean of CMIP6 historical 
simulations for 1979-2014. Enclosed by red lines is the monsoon domain based on 
the definition by Wang and Ding (2008) (c-d) 5-year running mean anomalies of 
(c) global land monsoon precipitation index defined as the percentage anomaly of 
the summertime precipitation rate averaged over the monsoon regions over land, 
relative to its average for 1979-2014 (the period indicated by light grey 
shading) and (d) the tropical monsoon circulation index defined as the vertical 
shear of zonal winds between 850 and 200 hPa levels averaged over 0º-20ºN, from 
120ºW eastward to 120ºE in NH summer (Wang et al., 2013; m s–1) in CMIP5 
historical and RCP4.5 simulations, CMIP6 historical and AMIP simulations. Summer 
and winter are defined for individual hemispheres: May through September for NH 
summer and SH winter, and November through March for NH winter and SH summer. 
The number of models and ensembles are given in the legend. The multi-model 
ensemble mean and percentiles are calculated after weighting individual members 
with the inverse of the ensemble size of the same model, so that individual 
models are equally weighted irrespective of ensemble size.

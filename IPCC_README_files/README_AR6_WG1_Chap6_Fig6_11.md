TEMPORAL REGIONAL MEAN NET EFFECTIVE RADIATIVE FORCING DUE TO AEROSOLS
============

Figure number: Figure 6.11
From the IPCC Working Group I Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report: Chapter 6

![Figure 6.11](../images/ar6_wg1_chap6_fig6_11_netERF_time_aer.png?raw=true)


Description:
------------
Time evolution of 20-year multi-model mean averages of the annual area-weighted mean regional net Effective Radiative Forcings (ERFs) due to aerosols for each of the 14 major regions in the Atlas, and global mean, using the models and model experiments as in Figure 6.10.
